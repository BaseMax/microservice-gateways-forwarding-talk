# "Next-Gen Microservice Gateways: Real-Time Forwarding with Bun"

Explore how Bun and TypeScript can be combined to build a lightning-fast, real-time gateway that forwards incoming requests to microservices based on live context. Learn how this modern architecture improves performance, simplifies routing logic, and reduces latency in microservice communication.

In today's microservice architectures, latency and scalability remain critical challenges, especially when handling live, dynamic routing of client requests. Traditional solutions like NGINX or Express-based proxies often introduce bottlenecks or complexity.
This session presents a high-performance gateway built with Bun and TypeScript, designed to forward HTTP requests in real time to sub-projects or microservices based on context, headers, or routing rules. We’ll dive into how Bun’s speed and native TypeScript support make it ideal for this task, and demonstrate a working use case of live request forwarding across multiple services — with benchmarks, architecture, and lessons learned.
Whether you're scaling a platform or designing your next startup backend, this session will show how to rethink your gateway layer using modern tools.

1. Learn how to design and implement a real-time gateway using Bun + TypeScript that efficiently forwards requests to microservices with minimal latency.

2. Discover how Bun can replace traditional reverse proxies and Node.js-based routers in microservice environments for better performance.
